Security
--------

We have two levels of accessibility in FDP. All resources (e.g., catalogs, datasets,...) are publicly accessible. You don't need to be logged in to browse them. If you want to upload your own resources, you need to be logged in. To get an account, you need to contact an administrator of the FDP. By default, all uploaded resources are publicly accessible by anyone. But if you want to allow someone to manage your resources (edit/delete), you need to allow it in the resource settings. 

We have two types of roles in FDP - an administrator and a user. The administrator is allowed to manage users and all resources. The user can manage just the resources which he owns.
